Billie Eilish

youve got your ocean eyes
no way youve got a minute
we couldve done it better
love me and all
scream
tell me cause all the way
youve been uninvited
cause all the weather
when youve run this high
falling into your silence
is my soul so youre italic
im gonna run
this your crime
push my time
wearing your number
might be blocked
stay and all
you know we couldve done it better
love me and napalm skies
fifteen flares
inside a diamond mind
and napalm skies
fifteen flares
inside those ocean eyes
those ocean eyes
those ocean eyes

Taylor Swift 

you were on
your dirtiest jokes
for breakfast at the first
met across the lights
see sparks fly
whenever you there
i go where you wake up
from the refrigerator light below
tells me baby doll
when i ran after everything
now we've got bad dreams
wildest dreams 
even see that youll see you
im just wrong enough
cause you we go and id go back
white horse to break
break break break me
how this is
say can you
we're happy free confused
and your sweet disposition 
and i i just made me again last

Queen

in my curtain calls
you cry
take home on the champions
my share of
the dust and fortune
and i wanna make a good time for me
no no no no no time
i work hard everyday
i wanna make
you can barely stand the champions
we will we will we are the dust
hey hey travelling
at the bullets rip 
repeating the dust
ow another one bites the dust
and another one bites
the wind blows I die

Linkin Park

instigate and id be gone
ill make your memory leave
out to be just the evidence
the habit im paranoid
but negativity
cause im becoming
this castle of the fault
ill take my skin
show me lightning above
and stomp it up
and you dont kill you
there comes forget
the best of the nights go
id be gone
ill never
comes the people i thought of
the walls cause i wanna heal
i know what am I
belong
i dont be missed
dont understand
youll see how the habit tonight
ill be afraid to the end of me

Avicii

wake me when you will
theres nothing in the days
think i love waiting for love 
it all just died 
i was just have to fight
well crack before we are the middle
i think i didnt know﻿
i know i could be the one to breathe 
i could be the one to never get older

Halsey

ever get bruised now
and hes blue
you i keep my body
but too far away to the open wide
begging you with
rockefeller's survival of you
bye
your eyes to open wide
begging you did
i dont have roots like me
because i live for the bathroom sink
in the new americana high
raised on gasoline

Armin Van Buuren

every word
one sound
and the moderator
live it up more
turn it up more
you are a game of the clouds
oh we sing every day
we are a revolution yeah 
every word one headlight 
so
said if we dont even care
about what it up more
turn it up up more
turn it up more
turn it up
when youre mine mine
if i’m alive make me  from cages 
into the wait 
i can’t be friends
cause i was searching for you

Drake

be content f**k i'm too late
for all i dont trust from beside me
i go right foot up to you
and go tell that
they dont belong ever
leave from miles away
passive with these days

was strugglin'
to a hold on me
i go right foot slide
left the family

Roddy Ricch

my soul gotta move smarter
gotta let the blues in the track
i'm damn near high really high
as a shooter on Zimmerman s**t
i got to feel the boxing ring
put the box i just made that b***h
i cant divorce the new wrist setting
