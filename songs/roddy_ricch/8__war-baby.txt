[Verse 1]
I'm from the bottom of the bottom, check your sources, baby
I'm a war baby, but I can't divorce the pavement
I'm a hood nigga that turned rich so I got Dior's latest
And you know I gotta stick to my roots, I still rock Jordans, baby (Yeah)
It was hell in the projects, I survived the storm
Got brothers in the sky, they die 'fore they born
I know the worst conditions make a champion
Look at my ice, froze like a mannequin
I'm underwater like I'm swimmin' and panickin'
Body bags zipped up like a laminate
The only solution for the opps is to stay inside
How your niggas say they rock, but they don't slide?

[Chorus]
'Cause we was hoppin' out in broad day
Serving fiends in the hallway (Yeah)
Promethazine 'til the mornin'
Hope I don't wake up tomorrow
We was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
I'ma make the choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da (La-da, la-da)
The choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da
Survived in the trenches, I'm a war baby (Mhmm)
Had to slide on the sliders, that ain't normal, baby (Mhmm)

[Verse 2]
Like the mob ties in Houston, we got rag ties
I pray the Lord forgive me the day that I got baptized
'Cause I'ma clutch the sticky every time a car passin' by
I don't wanna be Ricky or another victim to homicide
'Cause I know the soul never dies
I make the chrome-chrome fly
Bitch, I'm a wave, Roll Tide
Bullets at your face, Botox
My persona done got her tongue-tied
I was taught that a legend never dies
When it's time, gotta let the lead fly
'Cause I'm a war-war-war baby
Post-traumatic stress, I know the war changed me
Had to bend back but they could never break me
Had to slide

[Chorus]
We was hoppin' out in broad day
Serving fiends in the hallway
Promethazine 'til the mornin'
Hope I don't wake up tomorrow
We was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
I'ma make the choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da (La-da, la-da)
The choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da
Survived in the trenches, I'm a war baby
Had to slide on the sliders, that ain't normal, baby (Mhmm, yeah)

[Outro]
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
